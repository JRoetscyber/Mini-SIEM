## 📖 About  
**Lightweight SIEM** is a **security-first** project designed for researchers, students, and developers who want to explore **SIEM concepts** without the complexity of enterprise systems.  

It collects, analyzes, and alerts on log data in **real-time** — all while staying **minimal, fast, and hackable**.  

> ⚡ Think of it as a **lab-friendly Splunk/Elastic alternative**, built in Python.  

---

## ✨ Core Features  
🔍 **Log Collection** – ingest logs from files, syslog, or custom sources  
⚡ **Real-Time Monitoring** – stream processing for events  
📢 **Alerts & Rules** – regex & rule-based detection engine  
📊 **Dashboard Options** – terminal or Flask web interface  
🪶 **Lightweight** – designed for small labs & home networks  

---

## 🚀 Quickstart  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JRoetscyber/Mini-SIEM.git
cd Mini-SIEM
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Launch the SIEM

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configs live in `config/`.
You can define:

* **Data sources** → (log files, syslog, APIs)
* **Alert rules** → (regex, signatures, conditions)
* **Output** → (console, files, email, webhooks)

---

## 🖥️ Sample Terminal Output

```bash
[2025-09-01 20:44:22] 🔔 ALERT: Suspicious login attempt detected
[2025-09-01 20:45:10] ✅ Log source /var/log/auth.log ingested successfully
[2025-09-01 20:46:02] 🔔 ALERT: Possible brute-force detected from 192.168.0.12
```

*(replace with real logs/screenshots when ready)*

## 🛡️ Roadmap

* [ ] Threat intel feed support
* [ ] Role-based access control
* [ ] Cloud log ingestion (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* [ ] Visualization dashboards (Grafana / Plotly)

## ⚡ Closing Note

*"Security doesn’t need to be heavy – sometimes lightweight is all you need."*

---

🔥 That’s the **dark hacker-style version** — ASCII banner + cyber vibe.

Do you want me to also **make a second “enterprise-style” version** (clean, corporate look) so you can choose depending on your audience?
